# Silver Triples

The script `filter-silver.py` acquires a list of predictions from `predictions.large.jsonl.gz` -- a set of predictions generated by the best model in [https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04779](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04779), and it filters the predictions that:
- Involve at least one of the CUIs shared by Adrianna, and
- Has a probability of at least 0.5.

The resulting predictions are then saved in `silver_triples.tsv`.
