# Silver Triples

The script `filter-silver.py` acquires a list of predictions from `predictions.large.jsonl.gz` -- a set of predictions generated by the best model in [https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04779](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04779), and it filters the predictions that:
- Involve at least one of the CUIs shared by Adrianna (available in `umls_concepts_v2.csv`), and
- Has a probability of at least 0.5.

The resulting predictions are then saved in `silver_triples.tsv`, which contains:
- The subject of the relationship (`CUI1` in `MRREL.RRF`, see [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9685/table/ch03.T.related_concepts_file_mrrel_rrf/?report=objectonly)),
- Specific relationship label (`RELA` in `MRREL.RRF`, see [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9685/table/ch03.T.related_concepts_file_mrrel_rrf/?report=objectonly)),
- The object of the relationship (`CUI2` in `MRREL.RRF`, see [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9685/table/ch03.T.related_concepts_file_mrrel_rrf/?report=objectonly)).
